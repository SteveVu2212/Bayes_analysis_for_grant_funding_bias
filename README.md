# Introduction

Being learned and motivated by [Richard McElreath's course on Statistical rethinking 2022](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022), the project is to replicate a study in social science regarding of the grant research funding in the Netherlands from 2010-2012

In 2015, Romy van der Kee and Naomi Ellemers published a study about discrimination in the grant funding in the Netherlands. The authors collected 2,823 cases of prestigious grant for personal research funding among 9 disciplines. Their research finding is that gender bias favoring male applicants over female applicants in the prioritization of their quality researcher evaluation and success rates. The project will revisit that study under Bayesian perspective

The project is a case study of infering causal inference from an observational data set and domain knowledge. While the Bayesian inference is expected to quantify the uncertainty, the project follows the [Bayesian workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808) by Gelman et al. (2020) in the bayesian modeling process

All models are written in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org), a probabilistic programming language
